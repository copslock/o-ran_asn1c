1.Q: Is it possible to build the asn1c compiler on Win32?
1.A:
	At this point, the asn1c source code is tied to GCC-specific
	extensions in several key places. The CYGWIN environment with
	gcc compiler may be what are you looking for.

	Please also consider using the Online ASN.1 compiler at
		http://lionet.info/asn1c
	which generates platform-independent code.


2.Q: How to build a simplest BER (XER) encoder or decoder?
2.A:
	Please check the "Quick Start Guide" on ./doc/asn1c-quick.pdf
	Please check the "Examples" section of ./doc/asn1c-usage.pdf

	Also, try the following to build the X.509v3 parser:

		cd ./examples/sample.source.PKIX1
		make
		./x509dump -h
