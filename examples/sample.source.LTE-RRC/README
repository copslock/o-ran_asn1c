GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

The 3GPP TS 36.331 version 14.2.1 Radio Resource Control (RRC) Unaligned PER decoder.
Invoking `make` will compile the ASN.1 specifications from the
../lte-rrc-14.2.1.asn1 file. 

Currently only Makefile and binary sample in this directory.

OBTAINING THE LTE-RRC SPECIFICATION
===================================

To obtain this LTE-RRC ASN.1 specification or other version, you should go to
	http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/36331.htm
and download any version of LTE-RRC specification you like.

A .ZIP file with a Microsoft Word .DOC files will download shortly.

You should extract the ASN.1 modules from that .DOC file.
Be careful not to copy any preambles, chapter titles and other non-ASN.1 text.

lte-rrc-dump USAGE
==================

The lte-rrc-dump utility may be used to dump the contents of a Unaligned PER-encoded
LTE-RRC protocol data unit. Since LTE-RRC specification contains multiple PDUs,
a PDU must be selected manually using -p <PDU> command line option:

	./lte-rrc-dump -iper -p DL-DCCH-Message message.per
	./lte-rrc-dump -iper -p PCCH-Message message.per

The list of recognized PDUs may be obtained using `-p list`.

The full list of recognized command line options may be obtained with

	> ./lte-rrc-dump -h
