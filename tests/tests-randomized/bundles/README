This directory contains test bundles for randomized testing.
Each file contains a number of related ASN.1 types with variations in
contstraints that are intended to affect encoding and parsing.

 * Lines consisting of comments only are ignored.

 * The ASN.1 type can be written with "T ::=" prefix or without it, in which
   case it will be added automatically. It is done to simplify manual
   testing with ./check-bundles.sh -t <type>. For example,
        ./check-bundles.sh -t INTEGER
   is equivalent to
        ./check-bundles.sh -t "T ::= INTEGER"

 * By default, the random value generator attempts to generate values
   limited to very roughly to around 128 bytes. If huge values are desired
   (perhaps due to large constraints), the RMAX=<size> setting can be specified
   in the ASN.1 comments:

        T ::= VisibleString (SIZE(64000))    -- RMAX=64000
